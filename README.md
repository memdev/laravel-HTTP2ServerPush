### This repo is a fork of [JacobBennett/laravel-HTTP2ServerPush](https://github.com/JacobBennett/laravel-HTTP2ServerPush) with [this commit](https://github.com/JacobBennett/laravel-HTTP2ServerPush/pull/28) merged.

Server Push is a HTTP/2 concept which allows the server to speculatively start sending resources to the client. This can potentially speed up initial page load times: the browser doesn't have to parse the HTML page and find out which other resources to load, instead the server can start sending them immediately. [(source)](http://blog.xebia.com/http2-server-push/)

This package aims to provide the _easiest_ experience for adding Server Push to your responses. 
Simply route your requests through the `AddHttp2ServerPush` middleware and it will automatically create and attach the `Link` headers necessary to implement Server Push for your CSS, JS and Image assets.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:
``` bash
$ composer require vsg24/laravel-http2serverpush
```

Next you must add the `\JacobBennett\Http2ServerPush\Middleware\AddHttp2ServerPush`-middleware to the kernel. Adding it to the web group is recommeneded as API's do not have assets to push.
```php
// app/Http/Kernel.php

...
protected $middlewareGroups = [
    'web' => [
        ...
        \JacobBennett\Http2ServerPush\Middleware\AddHttp2ServerPush::class,
        ...
    ],
    ...
];

// config/app.php

'providers' => [
    ...
    JacobBennett\Http2ServerPush\ServiceProvider::class,
    ...
],
```

## Publish config

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="JacobBennett\Http2ServerPush\ServiceProvider"
```


## Usage

When you route a request through the `AddHttp2ServerPush` middleware, the response is scanned for any `link`, `script` or `img` tags that could benefit from being loaded using Server Push. 
These assets will be added to the `Link` header before sending the response to the client. Easy!

**Note:** To push an image asset, it must have one of the following extensions: `bmp`, `gif`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png` or `tiff`.

## Testing

``` bash
$ composer test
```
